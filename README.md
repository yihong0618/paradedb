[ParadeDB](https://paradedb.com) is an ElasticSearch alternative built on PostgreSQL,
engineered for lightning-fast full text, similarity, and hybrid search.

It offers the most comprehensive, Postgres-native search features of any Postgres
database, so you don't need to glue cumbersome services like a search engine or
vector database on top.

## Key Benefits

- ‚ö° **Speed**: ParadeDB is built in Rust on top of PostgreSQL and Tantivy,
  a Rust-based implementation of Apache Lucene. See our benchmarks [here](./benchmarks/README.md).

- üåø **Simplicity**: Consolidate your database and search engine
  into a single system, so you don't need to worry about keeping separate services
  in sync.

- üêò **SQL First**: Write search queries in SQL with ACID transactions.

- üöÄ **Scalability**: Scale to millions of rows with support for distributed
  search, high availability, backups, and point-in-time-recovery.

### Roadmap

- [ ] Search
  - [x] Full-text search with BM25 with [pg_bm25](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/tree/dev/pg_bm25#overview)
  - [x] Similarity search with [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector#pgvector)
  - [x] Sparse vector similarity search with [pg_sparse](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/tree/dev/pg_sparse#overview)
  - [x] Hybrid search with [pg_search](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/tree/dev/pg_search#overview)
  - [x] Real-time search
  - [ ] Faceted search
  - [ ] Distributed search (horizontal scaling/sharding)
  - [ ] Generative search
  - [ ] Multimodal search
- [x] Self-hosting
  - [x] Docker image & [deployment instructions](https://docs.paradedb.com/deploy/aws)
  - [x] Kubernetes Helm chart & [deployment instructions](https://docs.paradedb.com/deploy/helm)
- [ ] Cloud Database
  - [x] Managed cloud
  - [x] Self-serve cloud
  - [ ] Public Cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure) Marketplace Images
  - [x] High availability
- [ ] Web-based SQL Editor

## Creating a ParadeDB Instance

### ParadeDB Cloud

Try [ParadeDB Cloud](https://dashboard.paradedb.com) to get started with a free, managed ParadeDB instance.
Then connect to it with any Postgres client.

### Self-Hosted

#### ParadeDB Docker Image

To install ParadeDB locally or on-premise, simply pull and run the latest Docker image:

```bash
docker run \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=<user> \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<password> \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=<dbname> \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  -d \
  paradedb/paradedb:latest
```

Alternatively, you can clone this repo and run our `docker-compose.yml` file. By default, this will start the ParadeDB database at `http://localhost:5432`. Use `psql` to connect:

```bash
psql -h <hostname> -U <user> -d <dbname> -p 5432 -W
```

ParadeDB collects anonymous telemetry to help us understand how many people are using the project. You can opt-out of telemetry by adding `-e TELEMETRY=false` (or unsetting the variable) to your `docker run` command, or by setting `TELEMETRY: false` in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

#### ParadeDB Helm Chart

ParadeDB is also available for Kubernetes via our Helm chart. You can find our Helm chart in the [ParadeDB Helm Chart GitHub repository](https://github.com/paradedb/helm-charts) or download it directly from [Artifact Hub](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/paradedb/paradedb).

#### ParadeDB Extension(s)

To install the ParadeDB extension(s) manually within an existing self-hosted Postgres,
see the extension(s)' README. We strongly recommend using the ParadeDB Docker image,
which is optimized for running search in Postgres.

If you are self-hosting Postgres and are interested in ParadeDB, please [contact the ParadeDB team](mailto:hello@paradedb.com) and we'll be happy to help!
